I am a Research Scientist at the [National Institute of Aerospace](https://www.nianet.org/) working in the Safety-Critical Avionics Systems Branch at [NASA Langley Research Center](https://www.nasa.gov/langley).
I received my Ph.D. in Computer Science from the [University of Udine](https://www.uniud.it/en/uniud-international?set_language=en) (Italy) in May 2014. My PhD thesis was in part carried out at the Technical University of Valencia (Spain).
I earned a Bachelor’s and a Master’s degree in Computer Science from the University of Udine, both received with full marks and honors (summa cum laude).
I was a student at the scientific class of the [Scuola Superiore dell’Università of Udine](https://scuolasuperiore.uniud.it/) (an excellence University program for talented students), and I received my degree in June 2011 with full marks and honors.

My research interests include every aspect of formal methods.
In particular, I work on developing new tools for the formal verification and analysis of safety-critical avionics applications.
I am currently working on improving the reliability of airspace software involving finite-precision computations.
